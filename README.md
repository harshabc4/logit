## How It's Made:
On the frontend, Bootstrap was used to get a basic, visually appealing style.  Sass worked harmoniously with Bootstrap and allowed me to set up an easy watch script to autocompile any css changes for rapid testing.  Node supplies the power for the backend, utilizing MongoDB to store all of our material lists.  

All the time in my previous line of work I would see huge ineffeciencies.  The most frustrating was when our plans for the day had to be completely derailed because we ran out of a required material.  This will never happen again now that employees in the field and the office can be on the same page about materials.

**Tech used:**

## Future Plans:

- Add user profiles
- Build out materials page with more content and styling
- Improve UI for adding materials
-   add -1 in addition to +1 function
-   rework icons
- Add different jobsites and containers (dropdown menu)
